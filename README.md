# Angular Utilities

I am working on a large-scale AngularJS-based project and I'll be extracting
any useful re-usable components that I make and putting them here.

I'm following the convention of the [Ng-Boilerplate] (https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp) project of bundling
all relevant code together, so that you should be able to simply copy the
directory of the component you want to use, and it will include unit tests
and any other dependencies.

This code is made available under the MIT license, so feel free to use any of these is your projects. If you find any of them useful I'd be happy to get feedback!

- [**ordinalDate**](https://github.com/michaelbromley/angularUtils/tree/master/src/filters/ordinalDate) : Works like the built-in date filter, but will add the English ordinal suffix to the day.

That's all for now. Watch this space - there'll be more soon I expect.
